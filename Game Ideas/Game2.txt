 
A Top Down RTS, built around controlling a small band of units in a randomly generated cavernous system.
Its a cavern, so darkness should be a factor. The goal of the game would be to make it to the bottom, and collect the treasure.

MVP:
    - Unit control
    - Darkness related mechanics
        - torches
        - Enemies attack in the darkness
